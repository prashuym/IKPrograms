Count ways to reach the Nâ€™th stair
There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. He can climb a certain number of steps at once. For instance, the person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.
Solve the problem for the general case i.e. for n stairs, and different kinds of steps that can be taken (e.g. instead of only 1 or 2 steps, it could be 2, 3 and 5 steps at a time).

Example One
Input: n=1, steps=[1, 2]
Output: 1
Only one way to reach: [{1}]

Example Two
Input: n=2, steps=[1, 2]
Output: 2
Two ways to reach: [{1, 1}, {2}]

Example Three
Input: n=7, steps=[2, 3]
Output: 3
Three ways to reach: [{2, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 2, 2}]

Notes
Input Parameters: There will be two arguments: steps and n. 
An array of integer steps of size m denotes the steps the person can climb at a time and an integer n denotes the total number of stairs to be climbed. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a long integer.
Output: Return the number of ways to reach the last staircase.

Constraints:
1 <= m (size of the array steps) <= 100
1 <= steps[i], n <= 10000
